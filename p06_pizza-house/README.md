- I assumed that I would make a logo
for the pizza place.
- The main concept is showing stringy cheese
according to the adjustment of slider.
- I added functions for topping and
changing the color of signboard.

### Features(how to use)
- You can pick up a piece of pizza and the
stingy cheese will stimulate your appetite. 
- To make the pizza stand out,
the background and signboard were painted
in low-light colors.
- You can add potato, pepperoni, and olive with
the buttons.
