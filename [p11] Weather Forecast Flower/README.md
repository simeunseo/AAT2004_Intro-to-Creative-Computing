# Weather Forecast Flower [â–¶demo link](https://simeunseo.github.io/FINAL/)

### Motivation
How about making flowers
that have objective and numerical
information?

### How To Make
1. Receive real-time weather information for each location from API.
-> Problem : There was cross domain error but I couldnâ€™t solve it...
So I canâ€™t access API So I decided to save the data in json format and use it. (Not real-time information)
So I have to save the data one by one for each location
and it takes too much time.
So I limited the area to Seoul. ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
2. Let user choose the location
3. Express four weather information with flower
- temperature -> by color of flower

- humidity -> by petal thickness
