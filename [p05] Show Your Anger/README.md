Professor Tal Ben Shahir divides emotions into seven categories:
joy, interest, sadness, disgust, anger, fear, disrespect, and shame.
In particular, the professor said that ‘anger’ is the darkest and most
disturbing negative emotion a person feels.'
So we wanted to create a space where we could cheerfully express and
shake it off the anger that we often experience in our daily lives.

### Features (how to use)
마이크에 대고 힘껏 소리쳐 보세요.
When we feel anger, we feel like we want to shout to our heart's content.
To visualize the act of screaming, we compared anger to an exploding
volcano. The larger the volume of the voice, the more lava is infested, and
the more Volcano explodes.
